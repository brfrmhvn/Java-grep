I love my tabby CAT, Whiskers.
She has the softest fur and loves to be petted.
Yesterday, I found her Catlike tummy napping in a cardboard box in the corner of the living room.
When I opened the window, she jumped out and chased a butterfly in the garden.
Later, I caught her gnawing on the corner of my cat book.
She looked up at me with those big green eyes, as if to say "I'm sorry!"
Even though she can be mischievous, I wouldn't trade my cute little cat for anything in the world.
